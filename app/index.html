Access to high quality, organic and affordable food is very important for us, and we think that it should be available to everyone.</h2>

                As soon as you become a member you can place your first order, yay! Together we order in dry-food (from toothpaste to pasta) in bulk packaging. Fresh food doesn't have to be in bulk. We also have items that are popular, like oats, in stock to save costs and plastic! Payment is done during pick-up day through bank transfer or pin. For ordering, we use a free software called
                <a href="https://foodcoops.net"> <b> Foodsoft </b> </a>. You can learn more about how to order by joining us at any upcoming pick-up day.
